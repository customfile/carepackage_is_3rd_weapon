open the file in a text editor and change this values:

1. change displayName
2. change gunmodel
3. change animations (idleAnim -> adsDownAnim)
4. change timings for the animations (destabilizationRateTime -> sprintOutTime)
5. change dpadIcon to: hud_icon_WEAPONUWANT
6. change dpadIconRatio so it will scale correctly
7. use hideTags to set ur attatchments
	
for example: hideTags\tag_acog_2 tag_eotech tag_red_dot tag_iron_sight tag_silencer (would be thermal scope)
	     hideTags\tag_acog_2 tag_eotech tag_red_dot tag_thermal_scope (would be silencer)
	     hideTags\tag_acog_2 tag_eotech tag_red_dot tag_silencer tag_thermal_scope (would be normal)									 	


u will need a complete folder with all weapon files to fully have control and copy the values from the weapon u want (get an azza menu they usualy have them)

this file replaces the carepackage
